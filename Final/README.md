# You Need to know

The Compiler can translate SysY language (a subset of c language) to target ARM assembly code, the specific implementation is as follows:

- Implement basic data flow and control flow translation
- Realize the recognition, storage and calculation of floating point numbers
- Realize the recognition, storage and calculation of arrays
- The algorithm and optimization of linear scan register allocation and graph coloring register allocation are realized

For the test sample (from [CSCC Compilation competition](https://compiler.educg.net/#/)), the passing conditions are as follows:

- 1-1: All AC
- 1-2: All AC
- 2-1: All AC
- 2-2: All AC
- 2-3: All AC
- 2-4: All AC
- 2-5: Two not AC
- 2-6: Two not AC
